## 2. Cloud Cluster Architecture Overview

![Magic Castle Service Architecture](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRGFtPevjgM0_ZrkIBQY881X73eQGaXDJ1Fb48Z0DyOe61h2dYdw0urWF2pQZWUTdcNSAM868sQ2Sii/pub?w=1259&amp;h=960)

## 3. Initialization

### 3.1 Main File

1. Go to https://github.com/ComputeCanada/magic_castle/releases.
2. Download the latest release of Magic Castle for your cloud provider.
3. Open a Terminal.
4. Uncompress the release: `tar xvf magic_castle*.tar.gz`
5. Rename the release folder after your favourite superhero: `mv magic_castle* hulk`
3. Move inside the folder: `cd hulk`

The file `main.tf` contains Terraform modules and outputs. Modules are files that define a set of
resources that will be configured based on the inputs provided in the module block.
Outputs are used to tell Terraform which variables of
our module we would like to be shown on the screen once the resources have been instantiated.

This file will be our main canvas to design our new clusters. As long as the module block
parameters suffice to our need, we will be able to limit our configuration to this sole
file. Further customization will be addressed during the second part of the workshop.

### 3.2 Terraform

Terraform fetches the plugins required to interact with the cloud provider defined by
our `main.tf` once when we initialize. To initialize, enter the following command:
```
$ terraform init
```

The initialization is specific to the folder where you are currently located.
The initialization process looks at all `.tf` files and fetches the plugins required
to build the resources defined in theses files. If you replace some or all
`.tf` files inside a folder that has already been initialized, just call the command
again to make sure you have all plugins.

The initialization process creates a `.terraform` folder at the root of your current
folder. You do not need to look at its content for now.

#### 3.2.1 Terraform Modules Upgrade

Once Terraform folder has been initialized, it is possible to fetch the newest version
of the modules used by calling:
```
terraform init -upgrade
```

## 4. Configuration

In the `main.tf` file, there is a module named after your cloud provider,
i.e.: `module "openstack"`. This module corresdonds to the high-level infrastructure
of your cluster.

The following sections describes each variable that can be used to customize
the deployed infrastructure and its configuration. Optional variables can be
absent from the example module. The order of the variables does not matter,
but the following sections are ordered as the variables appear in the examples.

### 4.1 source

The first line of the module block indicates to Terraform where it can find
the HCL files that defines the resources that wil constitute your future
cluster. In the releases, this variable is a relative path to the cloud
provider folder (i.e.: `./openstack`).

**Requirement**: Must be a path to a local folder containing the Magic Castle
Terraform files for the cloud provider of your choice. It can also be a git
repository. Refer to [Terraform documentation on module source](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/modules/sources.html#generic-git-repository) for more information.

**Post build modification effect**: `terraform init` will have to be
called again and the next `terraform apply` might propose changes if the infrastructure
describe by the new module is different.

### 4.2 config_git_url

Magic Castle configuration management is handled by
[Puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(software)). The Puppet
configuration files are stored in a git repository. This is
typically [ComputeCanada/puppet-magic_castle](https://www.github.com/ComputeCanada/puppet-magic_castle) repository on GitHub.

Leave this variable to its current value to deploy a vanilla Magic Castle cluster.

If you wish to customize the instances' role assignment, add services, or
develop new features for Magic Castle, fork the [ComputeCanada/puppet-magic_castle](https://www.github.com/ComputeCanada/puppet-magic_castle) and point this variable to
your fork's URL. For more information on Magic Castle puppet configuration
customization, refer to [MC developer documentation](developers.md).

**Requirement**: Must be valid HTTPS URL to a git repository describing a
Puppet environment compatible with [Magic Castle](developers.md).

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.3 config_version

Since Magic Cluster configuration is managed with git, it is possible to specify
which version of the configuration you wish to use. Typically, it will match the
version number of the release you have downloaded (i.e: `9.3`).

**Requirement**: Must refer to a git commit, tag or branch existing
in the git repository pointed by `config_git_url`.

**Post build modification effect** rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.4 cluster_name

Defines the `ClusterName` variable in `slurm.conf` and the name of
the cluster in the Slurm accounting database
([see `slurm.conf` documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html)).

**Requirement**: Must be lowercase alphanumeric characters and start with a letter and can include dashes. cluster_name must be 63 characters or less.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.5 domain

Defines
* the Kerberos realm name when initializing FreeIPA.
* the internal domain name and the resolv.conf search domain as
`int.{cluster_name}.{domain}`

Optional modules following the current module in the example `main.tf` can
be used to register DNS records in relation to your cluster if the
DNS zone of this domain is administered by one of the supported providers.
Refer to section [6. DNS Configuration and SSL Certificates](#6-dns-configuration-and-ssl-certificates)
for more details.

**Requirements**:

- Must be a fully qualified DNS name and [RFC-1035-valid](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035).
Valid format is a series of labels 1-63 characters long matching the
regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])`, concatenated with periods.
- No wildcard record A of the form `*.domain. IN A x.x.x.x` exists for that
domain. You can verify no such record exist with `dig`:
    ```
    dig +short '*.${domain}'
    ```

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.6 image

Defines the name of the image that will be used as the base image for the cluster nodes.

You can use a custom image if you wish, but configuration management
should be mainly done through Puppet. Image customization is mostly
envisioned as a way to accelerate the provisioning process by applying the
security patches and OS updates in advance.

**Requirements**: the operating system on the image must be CentOS 7 or 8.

**Post build modification effect**: none - if this variable is modified, existing
instances will ignore the change and future instances will use the new value.

#### 4.6.1 AWS

The image field needs to correspond to the Amazon Machine Image id or AMI.
The AMI is specific to each region, so make sure to use the right AMI for
the region you chose.

#### 4.6.2 Microsoft Azure

The image field for Azure can either be a string or a map.

A string image specification will correspond to the image id. Image ids
can be retrieved using the following command-line:
```
az image builder list
```

A map image specification needs to contain the following
fields `publisher`, `offer` `sku`, and optionally `version`.
The map is used to specify images found in [Azure Marketplace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/cli-ps-findimage).
Here is an example:
```
{
    publisher = "OpenLogic",
    offer     = "CentOS-CI",
    sku       = "7-CI"
}
```

#### 4.6.3 OVH

SELinux is not enabled in OVH provided images. Since SELinux has to be
enabled for Magic Castle to work properly, you will need to build a custom image
with SELinux enabled.

To build such image, we recommend the usage of [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).
OVH provides a document explaining how to create a new image with Packer:
[Create a custom OpenStack image with Packer](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/public-cloud/packer-openstack-builder/)

Before the end of the shell script ran to configure the image, add the
following line to activate SELinux:
```
sed -i s/^SELINUX=.*$/SELINUX=enforcing/ /etc/selinux/config
```

Once the image is built, make sure to use to input its name in your `main.tf` file.

### 4.7 instances

The `instances` variable is a map that defines the virtual machines that will compose
the cluster, where the keys define the hostnames and the values are the attributes
of the virtual machines.

Each instance is identified by a unique hostname. The hostname
structure is the key followed by the instance 1-based index. The following map:
```hcl
instances = {
  mgmt     = { type = "p2-4gb", tags = [...] },
  login    = { type = "p2-4gb",     count = 1, tags = [...] },
  node     = { type = "c2-15gb-31", count = 2, tags = [...] },
  gpu-node = { type = "gpu2.large", count = 3, tags = [...] },
}
```
would spawn instances with the following hostnames:
```
mgmt1
login1
node1
node2
gpu-node1
gpu-node2
gpu-node3
```

Three attributes are expected to be defined for each instance:
1. `type`: cloud provider name for the combination of CPU, RAM and other features of the virtual machine;
2. `tags`: list of labels that defines the role of the instance;
3. `count`: number of virtual machines with this combination of hostname prefix, type and tags to create. (default: 1)

Tags are used in Terraform code to identify if devices (volume, network) needs to be attached to an
instance, while in Puppet code tags are used to identify roles of the instances. Next section defines
the tags that are expected by Magic Castle Terraform code and `puppet-magic_castle` environment, but
you are free to define your own tags.

#### 4.7.1 tags

Terraform tags:
- `login`: identify instances that will be pointed by the domain name A record
- `proxy`: identify instances that will be pointed by the vhost A records
- `public`: identify instances that need to have a public ip address and be accessible from Internet
- `puppet`: identify the instance that will be configured as the main Puppet server
- `ssl`: identify instances that will receive a copy of the SSL wildcard certificate for the domain

Puppet tags:
- `login`: identify a login instance (min. req: 2 CPUs, 2GB RAM)
- `mgmt`: identify a management instance (min. req: 2 CPUs, 6GB RAM)
- `nfs`: identify the instance that will act as an NFS server (min. req: 3 volumes named `home`, `project`and `scratch`)
- `node`: identify a compute node instance (min. req: 1 CPUs, 2GB RAM)

#### 4.7.2 Providing cloud specific attributes

For some cloud providers, it possible to define attributes for the instances. The attributes
that can be added in an instance map are defined in the following sections.

##### GCP

- `gpu_type`: name of the GPU model to attach to the instance. Refer to
[Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus) for the list of
available models per region
- `gpu_count`: number of GPUs of the `gpu_type` model to attach to the instance

#### 4.7.3 Post build modification effect

Modifying any part of the map after the cluster is built will only affect
the type of instances associated with what as modified at
next `terraform apply`.

### 4.8 Volumes

The `volumes` variable is a map that defines the block devices that should be attached
to instances that have the corresponding key in their list of tags. To each instance
with the tag, unique block devices are attached, no multi-instance attachment is supported.

Each volume in map is defined a key corresponding to its and a map of attributes:
- `size`: size of the block device in GB
- `type` (optional): type of volume to use (provider dependent, i.e: `gp2`)

Volumes with a tag that have no corresponding instance will not be created.

In the following example:
```hcl
instances{Â 
  server = { type = "p4-6gb", tags = ["nfs"] }
}
volumes {
  nfs = {
    home = { size = 100 }
    project = { size = 100 }
    scratch = { size = 100 }
  }
  mds = {
    oss1 = { size = 500 }
    oss2 = { size = 500 }
  }
}
```

The instance `server1` has three volumes attached to it, while the volumes tagged `mds` are
not created since no instances have the corresponding tag.

**Post build modification effect**: destruction of the corresponding volumes and attachments,
and creation of new empty volumes and attachments. If an no instance with a corresponding tag
exist following modifications, the volumes will be deleted.

### 4.9 public_keys

List of SSH public keys that will have access to your cluster sudoer account.

**Note 1**: You will need to add the private key associated with one of the public
keys to your local authentication agent (i.e: `ssh-add`) because Terraform will
use this key to copy some configuration files with scp on the cluster. Otherwise,
Magic Castle can create a keypair for unique to this cluster, see section
[4.16 - generate_ssh_key](#416-generate_ssh_key).

**Note 2**: The SSH key type has to be ECDSA or RSA for some cloud providers
including AWS and OpenStack because they do not support ed25519 and DSA
is deprecated.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.10 nb_users (optional)

**default value**: 0

Defines how many guest user accounts will be created in
FreeIPA. Each user account shares the same randomly generated password.
The usernames are defined as `userX` where `X` is a number between 1 and
the value of `nb_users` (zero-padded, i.e.: `user01 if X < 100`, `user1 if X < 10`).

Each user has a home folder on a shared NFS storage hosted by the management
node.

User accounts do not have sudoer privileges. If you wish to use `sudo`,
you will have to login using the sudoer account and the SSH keys listed
in `public_keys`.

If you would like to add a user account after the cluster is built, refer to
section [10.3](#103-add-a-user-account) and [10.4](#104-increase-the-number-of-guest-accounts).

**Requirement**: Must be an integer, minimum value is 0.

**Post build modification effect**: trigger scp of hieradata files at next `terraform apply`.
If `nb_users` is increased, new guest accounts will be created during the following
Puppet run on `mgmt1`. If `nb_users` is decreased, it will have no effect: the guest accounts
already created will be left intact.

### 4.11 guest_passwd (optional)

**default value**: 4 random words separated by dots

Defines the password for the guest user accounts instead of using a
randomly generated one.

**Requirement**: Minimum length **8 characters**.

**Post build modification effect**: trigger scp of hieradata files at next `terraform apply`.
Password of already created guest accounts will not be changed. Guest accounts created after
the password change will have this password.

To modify the password of previously created guest accounts, refer to section
([see section 10.2](#102-replace-the-guest-account-password)).

### 4.12 root_disk_size (optional)

**default value**: 10

Defines the size in gibibyte (GiB) of each instance's root volume that contains
the operating system and softwares required to operate the cluster services.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.13 sudoer_username (optional)

**default value**: `centos`

Defines the username of the account with sudo privileges. The account
ssh authorized keys are configured with the SSH public keys with
`public_keys`.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.14 hieradata (optional)

**default value**: empty string

Defines custom variable values that are injected in the Puppet hieradata file.
Useful to override common configuration of Puppet classes.

List of useful examples:
- Receive logs of Puppet runs with changes to your email, add the
following line to the string:
    ```
    profile::base::admin_email: "me@example.org"
    ```
- Define ip addresses that can never be banned by fail2ban:
    ```
    profile::fail2ban::ignore_ip: ['132.203.0.0/16', '8.8.8.8']
    ```
- Remove one-time password field from JupyterHub login page:
    ```
    jupyterhub::enable_otp_auth: false
    ```

Refer to the following Puppet modules' documentation to know more about the key-values that can be defined:
- [puppet-magic_castle](https://github.com/ComputeCanada/puppet-magic_castle/blob/main/README.md)
- [puppet-jupyterhub](https://github.com/ComputeCanada/puppet-jupyterhub/blob/main/README.md#hieradata-configuration)


The file created from this string can be found on `puppet` as
```
/etc/puppetlabs/data/user_data.yaml
```

**Requirement**: The string needs to respect the [YAML syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Syntax).

**Post build modification effect**: trigger scp of hieradata files at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.15 firewall_rules (optional)

**default value**:
```hcl
[
  { "name" = "SSH",     "from_port" = 22,    "to_port" = 22,    "ip_protocol" = "tcp", "cidr" = "0.0.0.0/0" },
  { "name" = "HTTP",    "from_port" = 80,    "to_port" = 80,    "ip_protocol" = "tcp", "cidr" = "0.0.0.0/0" },
  { "name" = "HTTPS",   "from_port" = 443,   "to_port" = 443,   "ip_protocol" = "tcp", "cidr" = "0.0.0.0/0" },
  { "name" = "Globus",  "from_port" = 2811,  "to_port" = 2811,  "ip_protocol" = "tcp", "cidr" = "54.237.254.192/29" },
  { "name" = "MyProxy", "from_port" = 7512,  "to_port" = 7512,  "ip_protocol" = "tcp", "cidr" = "0.0.0.0/0" },
  { "name" = "GridFTP", "from_port" = 50000, "to_port" = 51000, "ip_protocol" = "tcp", "cidr" = "0.0.0.0/0" }
]
```

Defines a list of firewall rules that control external traffic to the login nodes. Each rule is
defined as a map of fives key-value pairs : `name`, `from_port`, `to_port`, `ip_protocol` and
`cidr`. To add new rules, you will have to recopy the preceding list and add rules to it.

**Post build modification effect**: modify the cloud provider firewall rules at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.16 generate_ssh_key (optional)

**default_value**: `false`

If true, Terraform will generate an ssh keypair that would then be used when copying file with Terraform
file-provisioner. The public key will be added to the sudoer account authorized keys.

This parameter is useful when Terraform does not have access to one of the private key associated with the
public keys provided in `public_keys`.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

### 4.17 software_stack (optional)

**default_value**: `computecanada`

Defines the research computing software stack to be provided. The default value `computecanada`
provides the Compute Canada software stack, but Magic Castle also
supports the [EESSI](https://eessi.github.io/docs/) software stack (as an alternative) by setting this
value to `eessi`.

**Post build modification effect**: trigger scp of hieradata files at next `terraform apply`.

## 5. Cloud Specific Configuration

### 5.1 OpenStack and OVH

#### 5.1.1 os_floating_ips (optional)

**default value**: None

Defines a list of pre-allocated floating ip addresses
that will be assigned to the login nodes. If this variable is left empty,
(e.g. : `[]`) the login nodes' floating ips will be managed by Terraform.

This variable can be useful if you administer your DNS manually and
you would like the keep the same domain name for your cluster at each
build.

**Post build modification effect**: change the floating ips assigned to the login nodes.

#### 5.1.2 os_ext_network (optional)

**default value**: None

Defines the name of the external network that provides the floating
IPs. Define this only if your OpenStack cloud provides multiple
external networks, otherwise, Terraform can find it automatically.

**Post build modification effect**: change the floating ips assigned to the login nodes.

#### 5.1.3 os_int_network (optional)

**default value**: None

Defines the name of the internal network that provides the subnet
on which the instances are connected. Define this only if you
have more than one network defined in your OpenStack project.
Otherwise, Terraform can find it automatically.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

#### 5.1.4 os_int_subnet (optional)

**default value**: None

Defines the name of the internal subnet on which the instances are
connected. Define this only if you have more than one subnet defined in your
OpenStack network. Otherwise, Terraform can find it automatically.
Can be used to force a v4 subnet when both v4 and v6 exist.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.

### 5.2 Google Cloud

#### 5.2.1 project

Defines the label of the unique identifier associated with the Google Cloud project in which the resources will be created.
It needs to corresponds to GCP project ID, which is composed of the project name and a randomly
assigned number.

**Requirement**: Must be a valid Google Cloud project ID.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all resources at next `terraform apply`.

#### 5.2.2 region

Defines the name of the specific geographical location where the cluster resources will be hosted.

**Requirement**: Must be a valid Google Cloud region. Refer to [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#available)
for the list of available regions and their characteristics.

#### 5.2.3 zone (optional)

**default value**: None

Defines the name of the zone within the region where the cluster resources will be hosted.

**Requirement**: Must be a valid Google Cloud zone. Refer to [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#available)
for the list of available zones and their characteristics.

### 5.3 Amazon Web Services

#### 5.3.1 region

Defines the label of the AWS EC2 region where the cluster will be created (i.e.: `us-east-2`).

**Requirement**: Must be in the [list of available EC2 regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions).

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all resources at next `terraform apply`.

#### 5.3.2 availability_zone (optional)

**default value**: None

Defines the label of the datacentre inside the AWS region where the cluster will be created (i.e.: `us-east-2a`).
If left blank, it chosen at random amongst the availability zones of the selected region.

**Requirement**: Must be in a valid availability zone for the selected region. Refer to
[AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#using-regions-availability-zones-describe)
to find out how list the availability zones.

### 5.4 Microsoft Azure

#### 5.4.1 location

Defines the label of the Azure location where the cluster will be created (i.e.: `eastus`).

**Requirement**: Must be a valid Azure location. To get the list of available location, you can
use Azure CLI : `az account list-locations -o table`.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all resources at next `terraform apply`.

#### 5.4.2 managed_disk_type (optional)

**default value**: `Premium_LRS`

Defines the type of the instances' root disk and the type of the disks for the NFS storage.

**Requirement**: Must be a valid managed disk type label. Refer to
[managed_disk_type documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/virtual_machine.html#managed_disk_type)
to get a list of available values.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances and disks at next `terraform apply`.

#### 5.4.3 azure_resource_group (optional)

**default value**: None

Defines the name of an already created resource group to use. Terraform
will no longer attempt to manage a resource group for Magic Castle if
this variable is defined and will instead create all resources within
the provided resource group. Define this if you wish to use an already
created resource group or you do not have subscription level access to
create and destroy resource groups.

**Post build modification effect**: rebuild of all instances at next `terraform apply`.


## 6. DNS Configuration and SSL Certificates

Some functionalities in Magic Castle require the registration of DNS records under the
[cluster name](#44-cluster_name) in the selected [domain](#45-domain). This includes
web services like JupyterHub, Globus and FreeIPA web portal.

If your domain DNS records are managed by one of the supported providers,
follow the instructions in the corresponding sections to have the DNS records and SSL
certificates managed by Magic Castle.

If your DNS provider is not supported, you can manually create the DNS records and
generate the SSL certificates. Refer to the last subsection for more details.

**Requirement**: A private key associated with one of the
[public keys](#49-public_keys) needs to be tracked (i.e: `ssh-add`) by the local
[authentication agent](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/agent) (i.e: `ssh-agent`).
This module uses the ssh-agent tracked SSH keys to authenticate and
to copy SSL certificate files to the login nodes after their creation.

### 6.1 CloudFlare

1. Uncomment the `dns` module for CloudFlare in your `main.tf`.
2. Uncomment the `output "hostnames"` block.
3. In the `dns` module, configure the variable `email` with your email address. This will be used to generate the Let's Encrypt certificate.
4. Download and install the CloudFlare Terraform module: `terraform init`.
5. Export the environment variables `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`, where `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` is your Cloudflare account email adress and `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` is your account Global API Key available in your [CloudFlare profile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

#### 6.1.2 CloudFlare API Token

If you prefer using an API token instead of the global API key, you will need to configure a token with the following four permissions with the [CloudFlare API Token interface](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

| Section | Subsection | Permission|
| ------------- |-------------:| -----:|
| Account | Account Settings | Read|
| Zone | Zone Settings | Read|
| Zone | Zone | Read|
| Zone | DNS | Write|

Instead of step 5, export only `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_API_TOKEN`, and `CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN` equal to the API token generated previously.

### 6.2 Google Cloud

**requirement**: Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive)

1. Login to your Google account with gcloud CLI : `gcloud auth application-default login`
2. Uncomment the `dns` module for Google Cloud in your `main.tf`.
3. Uncomment the `output "hostnames"` block.
4. In `main.tf`'s `dns` module, configure the variable `email` with your email address. This will be used to generate the Let's Encrypt certificate.
5. In `main.tf`'s `dns` module, configure the variables `project` and `zone_name`
with their respective values as defined by your Google Cloud project.
6. Download and install the Google Cloud Terraform module: `terraform init`.

### 6.3 Unsupported providers

If your DNS provider is not currently supported by Magic Castle, you can create the DNS records
and the SSL certificates manually.

#### 6.3.1 DNS Records

Magic Castle provides a module that creates a text file with the DNS records that can
then be imported manually in your DNS zone. To use this module, add the following
snippet to your `main.tf`:

```hcl
module "dns" {
    source           = "./dns/txt"
    name             = module.openstack.cluster_name
    domain           = module.openstack.domain
    public_ip        = module.openstack.ip
}
```

Find and replace `openstack` in the previous snippet by your cloud provider of choice
if not OpenStack (i.e: `aws`, `gcp`, etc.).

The file will be created after the `terraform apply` in the same folder as your `main.tf`
and will be named as `${name}.${domain}.txt`.

#### 6.3.2 SSL Certificates

Magic Castle generates with Let's Encrypt a wildcard certificate for `*.cluster_name.domain`.
You can use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#dns-plugins) DNS challenge
plugin to generate the wildcard certificate.

You will then need to copy the certificate files in the proper location on each login node.
Apache configuration expects the following files to exist:
- `/etc/letsencrypt/live/${domain_name}/fullchain.pem`
- `/etc/letsencrypt/live/${domain_name}/privkey.pem`
- `/etc/letsencrypt/live/${domain_name}/chain.pem`

Refer to the [reverse proxy configuration](https://github.com/ComputeCanada/puppet-magic_castle/blob/main/site/profile/manifests/reverse_proxy.pp) for more details.

## 7. Planification

Once your initial cluster configuration is done, you can initiate
a planning phase where you will ask Terraform to communicate with
your cloud provider and verify that your cluster can be built as it is
described by the `main.tf` configuration file.

Terraform should now be able to communicate with your cloud provider.
To test your configuration file, enter the following command
```
$ terraform plan
```

This command will validate the syntax of your configuration file and
communicate with the provider, but it will not create new resources. It
is only a dry-run. If Terraform does not report any error, you can move
to the next step. Otherwise, read the errors and fix your configuration
file accordingly.

## 8. Deployment

To create the resources defined by your main, enter the following command
```
$ terraform apply
```

The command will produce the same output as the `plan` command, but after
the output it will ask for a confirmation to perform the proposed actions.
Enter `yes`.

Terraform will then proceed to create the resources defined by the
configuration file. It should take a few minutes. Once the creation process
is completed, Terraform will output the guest account usernames and password,
the sudoer username and the floating ip of the login
node.

**Warning**: although the instance creation process is finished once Terraform
outputs the connection information, you will not be able to
connect and use the cluster immediately. The instance creation is only the
first phase of the cluster-building process. The provisioning: the
creation of the user accounts, installation of FreeIPA, Slurm, configuration
of JupyterHub, etc.; takes around 15 minutes after the instances are created.

You can follow the provisioning process on the issuance by looking at:

* `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`
* `journalctl -u puppet`

once the instances are booted.

If unexpected problems occur during provisioning, you can provide these
logs to the authors of Magic Castle to help you debug.

### 8.1 Deployment Customization

You can modify the `main.tf` at any point of your cluster's life and
apply the modifications while it is running.

**Warning**: Depending on the variables you modify, Terraform might destroy
some or all resources, and create new ones. The effects of modifying each
variable are detailed in the subsections of **Configuration**.

For example, to increase the number of computes nodes by one. Open
`main.tf`, add 1 to `node`'s `count` , save the document and call
```
$ terraform apply
```

Terraform will analyze the difference between the current state and
the future state, and plan the creation of a single new instance. If
you accept the action plan, the instance will be created, provisioned
and eventually automatically add to the Slurm cluster configuration.

You could do the opposite and reduce the number of compute nodes to 0.

## 9. Destruction

Once you're done working with your cluster and you would like to recover
the resources, in the same folder as `main.tf`, enter:
```
$ terraform destroy -refresh=false
```

The `-refresh=false`Â flag is to avoid an issue where one or many of the data
sources return no results and stall the cluster destruction with a message like
the following:
```
Error: Your query returned no results. Please change your search criteria and try again.
```
This type of error happens when for example the specified [image](#46-image)
no longer exists (see [issue #40](https://github.com/ComputeCanada/magic_castle/issues/40)).

As for `apply`, Terraform will output a plan that you will have to confirm
by entering `yes`.

**Warning**: once the cluster is destroyed, nothing will be left, even the
shared storage will be erased.

### 9.1 Instance Destruction

It is possible to destroy only the instances and keep the rest of the infrastructure
like the floating ip, the volumes, the generated SSH hostkey, etc. To do so, set
the count value of the instance type you wish to destroy to 0.

### 9.2 Reset

On some occasions, it is desirable to rebuild some of the instances from scratch.
Using `terraform taint`, you can designate resources that will be rebuilt at
next application of the plan.

To rebuild the first login node :
```
terraform taint 'module.openstack.openstack_compute_instance_v2.login[0]'
terraform apply
```

## 10. Online Cluster Configuration

Once the cluster is online and provisioned, you are free to modify
its software configuration as you please by connecting to it and
abusing your administrator privileges. If after modifying the
configuration, you think it would be good for Magic Castle to
support your new features, make sure to submit an issue on the
git repo or fork the puppet-magic_castle repo and make a pull request.

We will list here a few common customizations that are not currently
supported directly by Magic Castle, but that are easy to do live.

Most customizations are done from the Puppet server instance (`puppet`).
To connect to the puppet server, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your SSH key is loaded in your ssh-agent.
2. SSH in your cluster with forwarding of the authentication
agent connection enabled: `ssh -A centos@cluster_ip`.
Replace `centos` by the value of `sudoer_username` if it is
different.
3. SSH in the Puppet server instance: `ssh puppet`

**Note on Google Cloud**: In GCP, [OS Login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access)
lets you use Compute Engine IAM roles to manage SSH access to Linux instances.
This feature is incompatible with Magic Castle. Therefore, it is turned off in
the instances metadata (`enable-oslogin="FALSE"`). The only account with admin rights
that can log in the cluster is configured by the variable `sudoer_username`
(default: `centos`).

### 10.1 Disable Puppet

If you plan to modify configuration files manually, you will need to disable
Puppet. Otherwise, you might find out that your modifications have disappeared
in a 30-minute window.

puppet is executed every 30 minutes and at every reboot through the puppet agent
service. To disable puppet:
```bash
sudo puppet agent --disable "<MESSAGE>"
```

### 10.2 Replace the Guest Account Password

In case the guest account password needs to be replaced, follow these steps:

1. Connect to `mgmt1` as `centos` or as the sudoer account.
2. Create a variable containing the current guest account password: `OLD_PASSWD=<current_passwd>`
3. Create a variable containing the new guest account password: `NEW_PASSWD=<new_passwd>`.
Note: this password must respect the FreeIPA password policy. To display the policy, run the following four commands:
    ```bash
    TF_DATA_YAML=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/terraform_data.yaml
    echo -e "$(ssh puppet sudo grep admin_passwd $TF_DATA_YAML | cut -d'"' -f2)" | kinit admin
    ipa pwpolicy-show
    kdestroy
    ```
4. Loop on all user accounts to replace the old password by the new one:
    ```bash
    for username in $(ls /mnt/home/ | grep user); do
      echo -e "$OLD_PASSWD" | kinit $username
      echo -e "$NEW_PASSWD\n$NEW_PASSWD" | ipa user-mod $username --password
      kdestroy
    done
    ```

### 10.3 Add a User Account

#### 10.3.1 With the Command-Line

To add a user account after the cluster is built, log in `mgmt1` and call:
```bash
$ kinit admin
$ IPA_ADMIN_PASSWD=<freeipa_passwd> IPA_GUEST_PASSWD=<new_user_passwd> /sbin/ipa_create_user.py <username> --sponsor <piname>
$ kdestroy
```

The home folder will be created automatically in the moments following the account creation.

The `<piname>` value will used to create a project folder in `/project` and a Slurm project.
The project will be named `def-piname`. This step is also done automatically.

#### 10.3.2 With Mokey

If user signup with Mokey is enabled, users can create their own account at
```
https://mokey.yourcluster.domain.tld/auth/signup
```

It is possible that an administrator is required to enable the account with Mokey. You can
access the administrative panel of FreeIPA at :
```
https://ipa.yourcluster.domain.tld/
```

The FreeIPA administrator credentials are available in the cluster Terraform output.

User created with Mokey do not have a project nor a Slurm account. To add a user to a project and a Slurm account,
add the user to a group with one of these prefixes : `ctb-`, `def-`, `rpp-` or `rrg-`. You can create new groups
with FreeIPA web interface or using the command-line.

### 10.4 Increase the Number of Guest Accounts

The number of guest accounts is originally set in the Terraform main file. If you wish
to increase the number of guest accounts after creating the cluster with Terraform, you
can modify the hieradata file of the Puppet environment.

1. On `puppet` and with `sudo`, open the file
    ```
    /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/terraform_data.yaml
    ```
2. Increase the number associated with the key `nb_users`
to the number of guest accounts you want.
3. Save the file.
4. Restart puppet on `mgmt1`: `sudo systemctl restart puppet`.
5. The accounts will be created in the following minutes.


### 10.5 Restrict SSH Access

By default, port 22 of the login node is accessible from the world.
If you know the range of ip addresses that will connect to your cluster,
we strongly recommend you to limit the access to port 22 to this range.

#### 10.5.1 OpenStack

You can use OpenStack webpage.

1. In OpenStack webpage, go to: **Project** â†’ **Network** â†’ **Security Groups**
2. In the Security Groups table, there should be a line named like your cluster
with the suffix `_secgroup`. Click on the corresponding **Managed Rules** button.
3. Find the line with **22 (SSH)** in the **Port Range** column and
click on the **Delete Rule** button.
Click **Delete Rule** in the following message box.
4. Click on the **Add Rule** button.
5. Select **SSH** in Rule dropping list
6. Define the range of ip addresses in the CIDR box.
7. Click on Add
8. Repeat 3 to 6 if you have multiple ip ranges.

Try to SSH in your cluster. If the connection times out, your ip address is out
of the range of you entered or you made a mistake when defining the range.
Repeat from step 3.

### 10.6 Add Packages to Jupyter Default Python Kernel

The default Python kernel corresponds to the Python installed in `/opt/ipython-kernel`.
Each compute node has its own copy of the environment. To install packages in
this environment, on a compute node call:

```
sudo /opt/ipython-kernel/bin/pip install <package_name>
```

This will install the package on a single compute node. To install it on every
compute node, call the following command from the sudoer account and where `N`
is the number of compute nodes in your cluster.

```
clush -w node[1-N] sudo /opt/ipython-kernel/bin/pip install <package_name>
```

### 10.7 Activate Globus Endpoint

Refer to [Magic Castle Globus Endpoint documentation](globus.md).

### 10.8 Recovering from puppet rebuild

The modifications of some of the parameters in the `main.tf` file can trigger the
rebuild of the `puppet` instance. This instance hosts the Puppet Server on which
depends the Puppet agent of the other instances. When `puppet` is rebuilt, the other
Puppet agents cease to recognize Puppet Server identity since the Puppet Server
identity and certificates have been regenerated.

To fix the Puppet agents, you will need to apply the following commands on each
instance other than `puppet` once `puppet` is rebuilt:
```
sudo systemctl stop puppet
sudo rm -rf /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/
sudo systemctl start puppet
```

Then, on `puppet`, you will need to sign the new certificate requests made by the
instances. First, you can list the requests:
```
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list
```

Then, if every instance is listed, you can sign all requests:
```
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign --all
```

If you prefer, you can sign individual request by specifying their name:
```
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign --certname NAME[,NAME]
```

### 10.9 Dealing with banned ip addresses (fail2ban)

Login nodes run [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), an intrusion
prevention software that protects login nodes from brute-force attacks. fail2ban is configured
to ban ip addresses that attempted to login 20 times and failed in a window of 60 minutes. The
ban time is 24 hours.


In the context of a workshop with SSH novices, the 20-attempts rule might be triggered,
resulting in participants banned and puzzled, which is a bad start for a workshop. There are
solutions to mitigate this problem.

#### 10.9.1 Define a list of ip addresses that can never be banned

fail2ban keeps a list of ip addresses that are allowed to fail to login without risking jail
time. To add an ip address to that list, on `puppet` add to
```
/etc/puppetlabs/data/user_data.yaml
```
the following line:
```
fail2ban::ignoreip:
  - x.x.x.x
  - y.y.y.y
```
where `x.x.x.x` and `y.y.y.y` are ip addresses you want to add to the ignore list.
The ip addresses can be written using CIDR notations.
The ignore ip list on Magic Castle already includes `127.0.0.1/8` and the cluster subnet CIDR.

Once the line is added, restart puppet on the login node(s):
```
sudo systemctl restart puppet
```

#### 10.9.2 Remove fail2ban ssh-route jail

fail2ban rule that banned ip addresses that failed to connect
with SSH can be disabled. To do so, on `puppet` add to
```
/etc/puppetlabs/data/user_data.yaml
```
the following line:
```
fail2ban::jails: ['ssh-ban-root']
```
This will keep the jail that automatically ban any ip that tries to
login as root, and remove the ssh failed password jail.

Once the line is added, restart puppet on the login node(s):
```
sudo systemctl restart puppet
```

#### 10.9.3 Unban ip addresses

fail2ban ban ip addresses by adding rules to iptables. To remove these rules, you need to
tell fail2ban to unban the ips.

To list the ip addresses that are banned, execute the following command:
```
sudo fail2ban-client status ssh-route
```

To unban ip addresses, enter the following command followed by the ip addresses you want to unban:
```
sudo fail2ban-client set ssh-route unbanip
```

#### 10.9.4 Disable fail2ban

While this is not recommended, fail2ban can be completely disabled. To do so, on `puppet` add to
```
/etc/puppetlabs/data/user_data.yaml
```
the following line:
```
fail2ban::service_ensure: 'stopped'
```

Once the line is added, restart puppet on the login node(s):
```
sudo systemctl restart puppet
```

## 11. Customize Magic Castle Terraform Files

You can modify the Terraform module files in the folder named after your cloud
provider (e.g: `gcp`, `openstack`, `aws`, etc.)
