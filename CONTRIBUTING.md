# Contributing to Magic Castle

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Magic Castle!


## How to Contribute

All contributions — whether fixing a typo, improving documentation, or adding major features — are welcome.  
Before contributing, please take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/computecanada/magic_castle/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### 1. Reporting Issues and Requesting Features
If you find a bug or have a feature request:
1. Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/computecanada/magic_castle/issues) to see if it has already been reported.  
2. If not, open a new issue using the appropriate template.  
   - Clearly describe the problem or enhancement.  
   - Include environment details (cloud provider, Terraform version, etc.) when relevant.  
3. In the event that the issue is related to one of Magic Castle’s subprojects, a maintainer may transfer your issue to the appropriate GitHub repository. You don’t need to determine the correct repository yourself. The maintainers will handle that for you.
