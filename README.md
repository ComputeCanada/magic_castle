# Magic Castle

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ComputeCanada/magic_castle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ComputeCanada/magic_castle)

[Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/) provides HPC infrastructure and support to every academic research institution in Canada. Compute Canada [uses CVMFS](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Accessing_CVMFS), a software distribution system [developed at CERN](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem), to make the Compute Canada research software stack available on its HPC clusters, and anywhere else with internet access. This enables replication of the Compute Canada experience outside of its physical infrastructure.

From these new possibilities emerged an open-source software project named Magic Castle, which aims to recreate the Compute Canada user experience in public clouds. Magic Castle uses the open-source software [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) and HashiCorp Language (HCL) to define the virtual machines, volumes, and networks that are required to replicate a virtual HPC infrastructure. The infrastructure definition is packaged as a Terraform module that users can customize as they require. After deployment, the user is provided with a complete HPC cluster software environment including a Slurm scheduler, a Globus Endpoint, JupyterHub, LDAP, DNS, and over 3000 research software applications compiled by experts with EasyBuild. Magic Castle is compatible with AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, OpenStack, and OVH.

## Setup

- Install [Terraform >= 0.12](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- Download the [latest release of Magic Castle](https://github.com/ComputeCanada/magic_castle/releases) for the cloud provider you wish to use.
- Uncompress the release
- Follow the instructions 
  - [OpenStack Cloud (Compute Canada)](openstack/README.md)
  - [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](aws/README.md)
  - [Microsoft Azure](azure/README.md)
  - [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](gcp/README.md)
  - [OVH Public Cloud (OVH)](ovh/README.md)
- For more details, refer to [Magic Castle Documentation](docs)

## Using a DNS Service

### CloudFlare

1. Uncomment the `dns` module for CloudFlare in your `main.tf`.
2. Uncomment the `output "dns"` block.
3. In the `dns` module, configure the variable `email` with your email address. This will be used to generate the Let's Encrypt certificate.
4. Download and install the CloudFlare Terraform module: `terraform init`.
5. Export the environment variables `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`, where `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` is your Cloudflare account email adress and `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` is your account Global API Key available in your [CloudFlare profile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).
6. Execute `terraform apply`.

#### CloudFlare API Token

If you prefer using an API token instead of the global API key, you will need to configure a token with the following four permissions with the [CloudFlare API Token interface](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

| Section | Subsection | Permission|
| ------------- |-------------:| -----:|
| Account | Account Settings | Read|
| Zone | Zone Settings | Read|
| Zone | Zone | Read|
| Zone | DNS | Write|

Instead of step 5, export only `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_API_TOKEN`, and `CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN` equal to the API token generated previously.

### Google Cloud

**requirement**: Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive)

1. Login to your Google account with gcloud CLI : `gcloud auth application-default login`
2. Uncomment the `dns` module for Google Cloud in your `main.tf`.
3. Uncomment the `output "hostnames"` block.
4. In `main.tf`'s `dns` module, configure the variable `email` with your email address. This will be used to generate the Let's Encrypt certificate.
5. In `main.tf`'s `dns` module, configure the variables `project_name` and `zone_name`
with their respective values as defined by your Google Cloud project.
6. Download and install the Google Cloud Terraform module: `terraform init`.
7. Execute `terraform apply`.

## Verifying the cluster state

On the login node :
- Verify SLURM cluster state: `sinfo`. You should see the number of nodes defined in `main.tf` and all nodes should have an idle state.
- Verify JupyterHub state: `systemctl status jupyterhub`. It should be active.
- Verify you can run interactive jobs: `salloc`
- Verify the home directories were created: `ls /home`. You should see one for each guest account, and the centos account.

If you used the CloudFlare DNS Service
- Verify the domain name: go to https://${domain_name}. It should be the JupyterHub login page.

## How Magic Castle Works

This software project integrates multiple parts that come into play at 
different steps of spawning the cluster. The following list 
enumerates the steps involved in order for users to better
grasp what is happening when they create clusters.

We will refer to the user of Magic Castle as the operator.

1. After downloading the latest release of the cloud provider of choice
and adapting the Terraform `main.tf` file, the operator launches 
`terraform apply` and accepts the proposed plan.

2. Terraform fetches the template hieradata yaml file from the 
puppet-magic_castle repo indicated by `puppetenv_git`. The version 
of that file corresponds to the value of `puppetenv_rev`. This template 
is read by terraform and variable placeholders are replaced by the values 
inferred from the values prescribed in `main.tf`.

3. Terraform communicates with the cloud provider REST API and requests the creation of the virtual machines.

4. For each virtual machine creation request, Magic Castle
provides a [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) file. This
file is used to initialize the virtual machine base configuration and installs 
puppet agent. The cloud-init file of the management node (`mgmt1`) also installs and configures
a puppetmaster. 

5. The puppet agents communicate with the puppetmaster to retrieve
and apply their configuration based on their hostnames.
