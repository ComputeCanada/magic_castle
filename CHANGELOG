## [8.0] 2020-06-19

Following release of CentOS 8 2004, AWS now provides an official CentOS 8 image that
has been tested and is functional with Magic Castle 8.0.

### Added
- Added the login node ids as output of the main Magic Castle Terraform module.
- Added a trigger to DNS module deploy_certs based on login node ids. If there is a modification to one of the login node state,
the certificates will be uploaded to the corresponding login node, without having to taint the `deploy_certs` resource manually
(PR #88).
- Added try function around access to index 0 of resource array to limit errors when destroying resources.
- [puppet] Added a resource in `profile::base` to remove terraform `local-exec` leftover empty scripts in /tmp.

- [puppet] fail2ban configuration is now done with puppet-fail2ban module. The `sshd` jail is now named `ssh-route`.
- [cloud-init] Bumped puppetserver to 6.12.0 and puppetagent to 6.16.0.
- Puppet hieradata yaml files are now uploaded with Terraform file provisioner instead of being embedded in mgmt1 userdata.
This means a change to the number of users, the guest password, or the hieradata variable no longer trigger a rebuild of mgmt1
but only a reupload of YAML files (PR #89)
- [docs] Various fixes (Issues #87, #92, #93)

### Removed
- Hieradata has been removed from puppetmaster.yaml template.
